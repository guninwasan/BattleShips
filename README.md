# BattleShips
Designed Battleships Game in C language. Since this is a university project, I'm putting up only the .exe file and cannot display the source file.

This game application features a board that updates after every shot the player/computer takes. The game follows all standard rules of the battleship game.

A few screenshots of how the game functions is shown below:
